### FAQ

**How to set up small icon ?**

Use the Android Asset Studio notification icons generator (https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-notification.html) to prepare small icons pack and replace temporary icons named **notify_icon_small.png** with the new ones in *\UnityProject\Assets\Plugins\Android\res\*

**How to set up big icon ?**

Same as small icon, but use launcher icons generator (https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html)
Just put the result into drawable directories *\UnityProject\Assets\Plugins\Android\res\* with name *notify_icon_big.png*. And in the SendNotification method set bigIcon to **"notify_icon_big"**.

If you want to use app icon just set bigIcon = **"app_icon"**.

**How to recompile plugin ?**

There is special gradle task called **exportJar**, just run it and grab plugin's jar in app/release/classes.jar

**How to create the AAR plugin ?**

There is special gradle task called **pluginCreate**, just run it and create a file in app/release/simple-android-notifications.aar

**How to get rid of obsolete warnings like "*OBSOLETE - Providing Android resources in Assets/Plugins/Android/res is deprecated, please move your resources to an Android Library. See "Building Plugins for Android" section of the Manual.*" ?**

You can avoid this by recompiling plugin with icons inside.
